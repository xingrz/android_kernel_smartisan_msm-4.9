SDM845 PMICs registers read/write interface

There are three PMICs of PM845,PM8005 and PMI8998 in the SDM845 Platform.In the
Qualcomm,there are the offered interfaces for the registers read/write.Firstly,
follow me to understand the related content of PMICs.

1.How to distinguish the PMICs in the Qualcomm?
The PMIC device consists of two slave IDs,which are known as the USID(unique slave IDs).
For example:
USID 0 and 1 are reserved for the primary core PMIC(PM8998/PM845)
USID 2 and 3 are reserved for the slave interface PMIC(PMI8998)
USID 4 and 5 are reserved for the slave core PMIC(PM8005)

2.How to read/write the registers in the PMICs by ADB?
For example:
1).PM8998/PM845
registers write
The following example is a register write 0xc240.
/d/regmap/spmi0-00# echo 0xc240 > address
/d/regmap/spmi0-00# echo 0x80 > data
/d/regmap/spmi0-00# cat data

registers read
The following example is a register read of 20 registers starting with 0x14000.
/d/regmap/spmi0-01# echo 20 > count
/d/regmap/spmi0-01# echo 0x4000 > address
/d/regmap/spmi0-01# cat data

2).PMI8998
registers write
The following example is a register write 0xc240.
/d/regmap/spmi0-02# echo 0xc240 > address
/d/regmap/spmi0-02# echo 0x80 > data
/d/regmap/spmi0-02# cat data

registers read
The following example is a register read of 20 registers starting with 0x1B600.
/d/regmap/spmi0-03# echo 20 > count
/d/regmap/spmi0-03# echo 0xB600 > address
/d/regmap/spmi0-03# cat data

3).PM8005
registers write
The following example is a register write 0xc240.
/d/regmap/spmi0-04# echo 0xc240 > address
/d/regmap/spmi0-04# echo 0x80 > data
/d/regmap/spmi0-04# cat data

registers read
The following example is a register read of 20 registers starting with 0x11400.
/d/regmap/spmi0-05# echo 20 > count
/d/regmap/spmi0-05# echo 0x1400 > address
/d/regmap/spmi0-05# cat data


3.The PMIC Arbiter debug bus is present starting at arbiter version 5.It has read and
write access to all PMIC peripherals regardless of ownership configurations.It cannot
be used on production devices because it disabled by an eFuse.

If you want to use it,you can do it by the sys interface /d/regmap/spmi1-xx.
